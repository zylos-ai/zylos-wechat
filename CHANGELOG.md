# Changelog

All notable changes to zylos-wechat will be documented in this file.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed
- Inbound WeChat media messages now download and forward image, file, video, and voice attachments into the existing C4 text bridge format
- Inbound media download now supports `full_url` fallback when encrypted query parameters are insufficient on their own
- Quoted-message media is now detected and forwarded instead of being dropped during inbound dispatch
- Voice messages now prefer `voice_item.text` as the message body and only fall back to `[voice: ...]` attachment forwarding when no transcript is available
- Confirmed login session test fixtures now use relative timestamps so the test suite does not fail after the hard-coded expiry window passes

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- Localhost-only admin HTTP control plane for login start/status/cancel/finalize and account health/disconnect
- Login session persistence with staged credentials and 30-minute terminal tombstones
- Runtime health snapshots tracking login health, replyability, and recent inbound/context timestamps
- Replyability refresh based on the latest valid `context_token`

### Changed
- Main runtime now exposes machine-driven account lifecycle control for `coco-dashboard` integration
- Admin token files now self-heal if missing or invalid

### Fixed
- Finalize now preserves `WECHAT_ACCOUNT_CONFLICT` so callers receive the correct 409 conflict semantics
